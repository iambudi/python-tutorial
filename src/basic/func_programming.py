Lambda, Closure, Map, Filter, Reduce
=========================================================================================
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which the primary method of 
computation is evaluation of pure functions. 
Although Python is not primarily a functional language, itâ€™s good to be familiar with 
lambda, map(), filter(), and reduce() because they can help write concise, high-level, 
parallelizable code. Look at src itertool_more.py for more functional variation
