# Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning
- makes machine learns explicitly
- data with clearly defined output given
- direct feedback given
- predicts outcome/future
- used for classification or regression problems
  
Example:
  a. Classification: Image Classification, Customer Retention, Diagnotics
  b. Regression: Forecasting, Predictions, Process Optimization, New Insight
## Unsupervised Learning
- machine understands the data
- does not predict or find anything specific
- best for dealing with unstructured data

**Example:** 
<ol type="a">
  <li>Clustering: Customer Segmentation, Targetted Marketing, Recommendation Systems</li>
  <li>Dimensionality Reduction: Structure Discovery, Meaningful Compression, Big Data Visualization</li>
</ol>

## Reinforcement Learning
- reward based learning
- learning from positive and negative reinforcement
- machine learns how to act in a certain environment
- maximize rewards. 

**Example:**
  - Realtime Decisions
  - Game AI
  - Learning Tasks 
  - Robot Navigation
  - Skill Acquisition
